# photobomb

Photobomb performs workflow tests against the ESP REST API.

It uses the client and structs provided by the ESP SDK package.

# TODO

- SPA front-end using a Javascript framework
- long-running server-to-browser connections via Websockets or HTTP/2
- auto-reload config.json
- graceful shutdown by trapping signals from OS
- track (and display in UI) per-bomb and per-bullet stats
- send logs to Splunk/Logstash
